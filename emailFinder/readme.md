## Email Address Finder

This extension will find as many email addresses in the Body, From, and CC fields that it can.

It will then put them into a menu.

The user will be able to click on the menu item, and copy the selected address to the clipboard.

The menu is currently mouse driven, but in time shortcut key selection will be available, which will allow for accessibility tools like Talon Voice to access the menus.

### Usage

Using the mouse an an exmple, simply click on the "Find Email/s" button.  It will search for all emails, in that message (and headers), and provide them in a list.  Click that email in the menu, and it will copy it to the clipboard.


Utilizing Talon Voice as an example, the user will be able to speak to Thunderbird, and give
commands such as:

 - Find Addresses (Activate the menu)
 - Copy Three (Copy the email address in menu entry three to the clipboard)

 If utilizing keyboard instead of voice, the user will be able to type commands such as:

  - CTRL B (Activate the menu)
  - C (Compose a message to the email address in menu entry three to the clipboard)


However, for now, it is mouse only.  Talon voice can still move the mouse, to the menu position and click, if users would like to use it whilst in development.


For users with RSI, and other physical disabilities, this will assist to reduce their reliance
on the mouse, especially for those that are dealing with emails and email addresses all day.
